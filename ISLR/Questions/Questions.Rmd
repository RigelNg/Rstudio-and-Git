```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

 Is the way that computer chooses the first node equals to the significance of the coefficent in basic linear regression??

eg. if the algorithm decides that the first split occurs at x1 < 0.5 and x1> 0.5, does this make x1 the most important feature??

 In Linear regression the training error always decreases as the model becomes more flexibile, how come this is not the case in decision trees??
