```{r cars}

set.seed(1)

y = runif(200,0,100)
x = rnorm(200,y,1)

plot (x,y)
linear = lm(y~x)
linear

x1 = rnorm(200,y,10)
plot(y,x1)
linear1 =  lm(y~x)
linear1

x2 = rnorm(200, rnorm(200,y,1),1)
plot(y,x2)
linear2 = lm(y~x2)
linear2
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
