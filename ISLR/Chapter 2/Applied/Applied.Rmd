#Question 8 , Chapter 2 applied

#Since we have ISLR pre-installed, we can simply load it from the librarys 

college=ISLR::College

#We use head to show the head of the data frame since the entire data frame is too big to include here
head(college)

#We can also show the first 6 colleges by using row names and head together

head(rownames(college))

#i)

# to get an overview of the the dataframe

summary(college)

#ii)
pairs(college[,1:10])

#iii)We can also do this by attaching the varaibles by using attach(college)

plot(college$Private, college$Outstate)

#iv) 

Elite= rep("No",nrow(college))
Elite[college$Top10perc>50]= "Yes"
Elite = as.factor(Elite)
college = data.frame(college,Elite)

summary(college)

plot(college$Elite, college$Outstate)

# we can add lables to it as well 

plot(college$Elite, college$ Outstate, xlab = "Elite University", ylab = "Out of state tuition fee")

#As from the graph, we can clearly see that that the out of state tuition fee for an elite university is much higher than a non-elite university. 


#v)

par(mfrow=c(2,2))


hist(college$Apps)
hist(college$Accept)
hist(college$Enroll)
hist(college$Top10perc)
hist(college$Top25perc)

#vi)

# We can use plot to understand relationship between variables. 

#say we are trying to understand the relationship between the percentage of PHD and the percentage of alumni who donates

plot(college$PhD, college$perc.alumni)

# we can see that there is a slight positive trend with a lot of variation 

#We can also try to understand the
