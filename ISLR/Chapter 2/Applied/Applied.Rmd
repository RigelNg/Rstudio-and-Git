#Question 8 , Chapter 2 applied

#Since we have ISLR pre-installed, we can simply load it from the librarys 

college=ISLR::College

#We use head to show the head of the data frame since the entire data frame is too big to include here
head(college)

#We can also show the first 6 colleges by using row names and head together

head(rownames(college))

#i)

# to get an overview of the the dataframe

summary(college)

#ii)
pairs(college[,1:10])

#iii)We can also do this by attaching the varaibles by using attach(college)

plot(college$Private, college$Outstate)

#iv) 

Elite= rep("No",nrow(college))
Elite[college$Top10perc>50]= "Yes"
Elite = as.factor(Elite)
college = data.frame(college,Elite)

summary(college)


#v)

hist(college$Apps)
plot(college$Elite, college$Outstate)

#vi) 




```

## Including Plots
