 The data set 'Genes' contains a single response Y (whether the leaf length for a particular plant was bigger than average) and p = 3,235 genetic markers. 
 . If Y = 1, then the leaf length is greater than average for that plant and Y = 0 otherwise. 
 . The genetic markers are coded as 1, 0.5, 0. A higher value suggests that the gene is more 'switched on'. You may treat these as continuous variables. 
 
 The Question?
 . Determine which, if any, of the genetic markers are associated with with a greater than average leaf length.
