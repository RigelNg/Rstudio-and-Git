## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r }
set.seed(1)

y = runif(200,0,100)
x = rnorm(200,y,1)

plot(x,y)

linear = lm(y~x)
linear

x1 = rnorm(200,y,10)
plot(y,x1)
linear1 =  lm(y~x)
linear1

x2 = rnorm(200, rnorm(200,y,1),1)
plot(y,x2)
linear2 = lm(y~x2)
linear2

x3 =  rnorm(200, 0.3*y, 1)

plot(x3,y)
linear3 = lm(y~x3)
linear3
```

## Multiplie Linear regression

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r multiple linear regression}

## The true underlying relationship y= x3+x4 with errors....

x1= runif(200,0,50)
x2=runif(200,0,100)

y=rnorm(200,x1+x2,1)
linear4 = lm(y~x1+x2)
linear4

plot(x1,y)
plot(x2,y)
plot(x1+x2,y)
plot(linear4)
#linear3 = lm(y~x3,x4)
#linear3

linear5 = lm(y~x1)
linear5
linear6  = lm(y~x2)
linear6

y2 = rnorm(200,0.3*x1-0.4*x2,1)
plot(x1+x2, y2)

linear7= lm(y2~x1+x2)
linear7

plot(x1,x2)
cor(x1,x2)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
